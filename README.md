# Talk Standards

* Presentations should be ~30 minutes long, demo included, with extra ~5 minutes for the Q & A session.
* Lightning talks should be ~5-10 minutes.
* We have an international audience, so we prefer talks in English (but it's not a stopper)
* Ideally we will do between 2 and 3 presentations per meetup, depending on its length.
